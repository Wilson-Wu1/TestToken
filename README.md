# Willy Token

[Willy Token](https://willytoken.ca)
is a basic decentralized application comprised of an ERC20 token smart contract and a front-end website.

The [contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x2057201f0302d873439fea544ed3c7542acc48e1) was deployed on the Polygon Mainnet.



## Functions
The frontend supports the following functions:

- Query an addresses balance of Willy Tokens
- Mint Willy Tokens
- Transfer Willy Tokens to another address
- Display the number of addresses holding Willy Tokens
- Display the total circulating supply of Willy Tokens
- Display the maximum supply of Willy Tokens

- Prompt the user to login to a wallet
- Display the current address connected to the website
- Adjust the current address display if a user switches addresses
- Handle and display an error if a user is connected to the incorrect network
- Prompt the user to add Willy Tokens to their wallet

 


## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
